#Variables = no need to specify the data type, just assign them

d = "anything"  #strings

a,d = d,a       #To swap the values of variables

#They can change at any time, so if you stored a str it can also be a int if you assign it

#There are no means to create constants, so you can only indicate they are so by using UPPER_CASE to indicate it
