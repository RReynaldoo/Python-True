    # module = a file containing code you want to include in your program
    #          use 'import' to include a module (built-in ro your own)
    #          useful to break up a large program reusable separate files
    
    # import math            |  Imports the entire module                (Math.e)
    # import math as M       |  Imports the module with a different name (m.e)
    # from math import e     |  Imports a value/function from the module (e)
    
    # You can create a module by creating another python file, building functions and then importing them
    # and use the functions as any other module pre incorporated
